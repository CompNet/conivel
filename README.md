# Learning to Rank Context for Named Entity Recognition Using a Synthetic Dataset


# Installing dependencies

Use `poetry install` to install dependencies, and `poetry shell` to activate the resulting python virtual env. 


# Generated Dataset

The generated context retrieval can be found under `runs/gen/genv3`
for Alpaca-7b, and under `runs/gen/genv3_13b/` for Alpaca-13b.
